# ShiftSure

ShiftSure is a parametric income protection platform for quick-commerce delivery workers, offering weekly coverage, rider-filed claims, AI-assisted claim verification, and automated payout management.


## Overview

Riders on quick-commerce platforms (for example Zepto, Blinkit, or Instamart) earn in short, hyperlocal windows. Heavy rain, flooding, dark-store outages, zone closures, extreme heat, or hazardous air quality can sharply cut weekly earnings. ShiftSure plans to cover that **income loss only**. It is not health, accident, life, or vehicle insurance.


### Planned product flow

1. A rider buys weekly coverage.
2. The rider declares working shifts.
3. A disruption occurs (weather, outage, closure, etc.).
4. The rider files a claim.
5. The system verifies the claim against external signals and fraud checks.
6. The claim is approved or rejected; approved claims are paid out to the rider's wallet.

Disruption events act as evidence for verification. They do not pay out on their own.
